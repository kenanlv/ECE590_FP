# ECE590_FP

This repository serves for the purpose of the final project for ECE 590 Embeded System Class.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the depth of our learning result from the class.

Project description:
  Extend the robot finite state machine example to include a simulation of the robot in a 2D environment, a simulation of an intruder, a     simulation of the recharge station, and a simulation an operator who can send the reset event. Export and visulize data you collect. See   previous option for a note on speeding up simulations.

All states must have the correct transition to other states with emitting the correspond events. 
At first the project should show transitions, states, and events by printing out to the screen, then, at the end of the project, it should be able to show everything on a 2-D environment with simulated robots, host, charging station, and intruders. With real-time states, events, and transitions printed out. 
This project will gave me a depth view of the Finite State Mahine with understanding and mastering how the staets change and how events trigger transitions and generated at the process of transition. 
Ideally, achieving 2-D view of the result would count as a success for this project. But this is subjective to the difficulty to the technical part and time devoted on this project. Very likely, I might change the final goal for this project.

Resources will be using:
  ECE590 elma file, 2-D drawing software(TBD)

Five Milestone
  - Having something that is executable (the robot skeleton.) Should be finished at the first week.
  - Add additional feature to the robot: differnt events, states, and transistions. Should be finished at the first week.
  - Export data so user could visualize it. Should be finished at the second week.
  - Find a user friendly 2-D drawing software. Should be finished at the second week.
  - (Extra) Exporting the code onto a real physical robot with different sensors trigger different events. This extra step is entirely         depends on how much time I have left.
